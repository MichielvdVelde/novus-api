# Novus API

Provides a HTTP(s) API for my home automation system based on MQTT and [novus-component](https://github.com/MichielvdVelde/novus-component).
The API provides end-points for reading sensor values as well as controlling actuators.

This code is useless for anyone besides me, although you're free to browse and copy/steal
what you think you can use.
